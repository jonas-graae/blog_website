# Blog Website

This website is my solution to an assignment on Udacity's program "Frontend Webdevelopment". 

The goal was to create stylish blog site, that has page with overview of blogposts, as well as template the blog posts. 

This website is inspired by a blog design found on [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/781093129109271638/)
