# Blog Website

This website is my solution to an assignment on Udacity's program "Frontend Webdevelopment". 

The goal was to create stylish blog website, that has a page with overview of blogposts, as well as a template for the blog posts. 

This website is inspired by a blog design found on [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/781093129109271638/)
